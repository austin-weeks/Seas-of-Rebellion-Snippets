## Code Samples
Here are a few of the more interesting pieces of my codebase:
- [The Player](/Player.cs) - Handles player movement and input logic.
- [Tree Boss](/Arbolis.cs) - Main logic for the game's second boss, √Årbolis.
- [Save System](/SaveSystem.cs) - Implements the game's JSON based save system.
- [The Merchant](/Merchant.cs) - Main logic for shops.
